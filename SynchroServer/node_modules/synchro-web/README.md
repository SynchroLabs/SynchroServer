TODO: Browserify as dev dependency (can we build with installing it -g?)

      Build and check in bundle.js?

TODO:

Image scale

Review div's in layout - particularly inline-flex vs flex for flexboxes, inline-block for other divs (rect)

Device scaling - currently logical units == px

Device size in device metrics

Font sizing (accurate pt size, but seems to small on Web)

Star sizing implementation (WrapPanel?)

Lots of alignment issues (how do these work in the mobile envs?  Default margins?)
    Samples: hello, toggle, list, etc.

Login sample - remove cancel button (currently produces err, verify on mobile)

Contacts sample - ListView does not scroll within dimensions (but overflows)

ScrollView (div with scroll overflow?)

Review all controls for overflow behavior

GridView ? (Who else implements this?)

Back button id and class (synchro-back) for styling via CSS
