TODO: Browserify as dev dependency (can we build with installing it -g?)

      Build and check in bundle.js?

TODO:

Device scaling - currently logical units == px

Device size in device metrics

Font sizing (accurate pt size, but seems to small on Web)

Lots of alignment issues (how do these work in the mobile envs?  Default margins?)
    Samples: hello, toggle, list, etc.
    Probably going to mean looking at default margins (esp <p>)

WrapPanel - review star sizing (compare to mobile?)
