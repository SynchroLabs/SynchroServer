TODO: Browserify as dev dependency (can we build with installing it -g?)

      Build and check in bundle.js?

TODO:

Image scale

Device scaling - currently logical units == px

Device size in device metrics

Font sizing (accurate pt size, but seems to small on Web)

Lots of alignment issues (how do these work in the mobile envs?  Default margins?)
    Samples: hello, toggle, list, etc.

Login sample - remove cancel button (currently produces err, verify on mobile)

WrapPanel - review star sizing (compare to mobile?)

GridView ? (Who else implements this?)
