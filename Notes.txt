Mobile Application As A Service (MAAAS) - Server
=================================================

App
    Branches
    Pages

UX Test - Test in web view (see/edit view model live)
Unit Test (app unit test)

Mock support for test environment

Diff
    One page / all pages
    Diff against branch

Deploy (to branch)
    One page / all pages
    Version control / comments

Team support (track who made which changes, deployments, etc)

Revision history / revert

Metrics/analytics

Logging system

MAAAS clients tied to app (with resource)
    Optionally specify branch (so one client app can run "production", one can run "staging", etc)
    App spec - app{branch} - branch defaults to "production"

Client builder
    Provide platform resources - app name, icon, etc.
    Specify capabilities (location, photo library, etc)
    Produce build images for download (signed by MAAAS or prepared for signing by customer)
    Pre-build test client (auth to MAAAS, welcome page, enter app spec, remembers app specs, choose previously entered app spec)

Persistent sessions
    Redis, Azure cache+table

Push notifications / badges / etc

Localization (language/locale reported from client / token substitution)

Resources (shared values that can be used as tokens?)
    Resolution/scale resource mapping

Styles (collection of attributes that can be applied to a control - integrate with resources?)

Debugging using node debugger
------------------------------
https://code.google.com/p/v8/wiki/DebuggerProtocol

node debug app.js
telnet <host> 5858
http://nodejs.org/api/debugger.html
https://github.com/joyent/node/blob/master/lib/_debugger.js
https://github.com/joyent/node/blob/master/deps/v8/src/d8.js
https://github.com/sidorares/node-cli-debugger

To Do
---------
Disable editing/saving of non-user modules
Allow edit/save of user modules during debug?
Move breakpoints on edit?
Manage/store breakpoints so they can be set when not debugging, remembered between debug page visits (store in persistent session?)
Module "New" and "Delete" ("new" content should come from default template)
