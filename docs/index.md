# Synchro - The Cloud-Based Mobile App Platform

## Native mobile apps, running under Node.js, in the cloud

Synchro is a revolutionary new platform that allows enterprise developers to create high quality, high performance, cross-platform
native mobile applications using simple and familiar tools - JavaScript and the [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) framework. You can use
Synchro to create apps that install and run on mobile devices, but where all of your application code, including client interaction 
logic, runs in the cloud.

To get an idea of what Synchro is and how it works, see the [Introduction to Synchro](general/intro).

You can install Synchro Server, generate a simple app, and run it, in just a few commands: 

    $ npm install -g synchro
    $ synchro init
    $ synchro new hello
    $ npm start

For detailed instructions on playing with real Synchro apps and getting a Synchro Server environment installed locally, see 
[Getting Started](general/getting-started).

For even more information, visit [Synchro Labs, Inc.](https://synchro.io) or the GitHub repository for 
[Synchro Server](https://github.com/SynchroLabs/SynchroServer).
