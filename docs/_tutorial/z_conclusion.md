We hope this tutorial has given you a good understanding of the core concepts of the Synchro platform.

If you would like to explore more Synchro app code, we recommend:

[Synchro Samples](https://github.com/SynchroLabs/SynchroSamples) - A large number of simple modules, each demonstrating a single concept 
or the usage of a specific type of control.

[Synchro Civics](https://github.com/SynchroLabs/SynchroCivics) - A complete application that shows how to integrate all of these Synchro
concepts, techniques, and controls.  This is the same Synchro app that drives our Synchro Civics mobile client app available in all app stores.

__Happy Coding with Synchro!__
