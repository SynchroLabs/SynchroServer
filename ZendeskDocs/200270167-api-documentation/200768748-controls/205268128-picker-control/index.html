      <h1>Picker Control</h1>
      <h3>Binding</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="/hc/en-us/articles/219657607">Common Control Attributes</a></li>
<li><code>items</code> - the array of elements in the list.</li>
<li><code>itemValue</code> (defaults to "{$data}") - a token string applied to each "items" element to construct the string to display in the list. For example: "User: {firstName} {lastName}".</li>
<li><code>selection</code> - the location in the view model where the current selection is maintained. If select is Single, then the location referred to by selection should contain a single item. If select is Multiple, then the location referred to by selection should contain an array of zero or more items.</li>
<li><code>selectionItem</code> (defaults to $data) - This is what is placed into "selection" (per item) and this is applied to each item in "items" for the purpose of matching items with selection items when setting selection state for the control. For example, if the selectionItem was "{itemId}", then the selection binding would be one or more elements of the "{itemId}" applied to the selected items. When resetting item selection, "{itemId}" will be applied to each list item, and the result will be compared with the value(s) in "selection" to see if the item should be selected. In the case of the default, the selection list will contain deep copies of the list view items, and the selection comparison will be a deep compare of those items with the list view items.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Commands</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><code>onSelectionChange</code> command - context is the item that is now selected</li>
</ul>
<h3>Example:</h3>
<pre><code>{ control: "picker", width: 150, binding: {
    items: "colors", itemContent: "Color: {name}", selection: "selectedColor", selectionItem: "value", 
    onSelectionChange: { command: "clicked", colorName: "{name}" } 
    } 
}</code></pre>
