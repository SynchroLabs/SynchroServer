      <h1>Hello 3: View dynamically updated from ViewModel</h1>
      <p>In the previous example we saw View elements populated with data from the ViewModel data object.  It is also possible for View elements to set data in the ViewModel data object.</p>
<p>In the module below, we have added an edit control to the View that is bound to the <em>userName</em> value of the ViewModel.  That means that the edit control will be initially populated with the value of the <em>userName</em> from the ViewModel.  And it also means that when the content of the edit control changes, it will be immediately reflected in the <em>userName</em> field of the ViewModel data object (and any other View elements bound to that item will thus be updated in real-time).  In the example below, as you change the contents of the edit control, you will see the Hello message updated in real-time.</p>
<p>The other concept demonstrated below is that any View control attribute may be bound to any ViewModel data element, with appropriate conversion performed automatically.  The <em>visibility</em> attribute of the text control is bound to the <em>userName,</em> such that if the <em>userName</em> is empty, the text field will be invisible, otherwise it will be visible.  </p>
<p>Both of these techniques demonstrate that it is possible to write responsive interfaces that do not require procedural code (or communication between client and server). </p>
<p><strong>Module: hello3.js - <a href="https://github.com/SynchroLabs/SynchroTutorial/blob/master/hello3.js">View on GitHub</a></strong></p>
<pre><code>exports.InitializeViewModel = function(context, session)
{
    return {
        userName: "Jane Smith"
    };
}

exports.View = {
    title: "Hello World 3",
    elements: [
        <span class="mark">{ control: "edit", binding: "userName", placeholder: "enter name" },</span>
        { control: "text", value: "Hello {userName}", <span class="mark">visibility: "{userName}"</span> }
    ]
};</code></pre>
<p>This module will look like this on mobile client (and will update in real-time as the the user name is edited): </p>
