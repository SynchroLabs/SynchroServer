The files in this directory consist of an export of the Synchro ZenDesk (Help Center) docs.  

The export was created using this program: https://github.com/pjmuller/zendesk-helpcenter-export

The intent is to convert this content to markdown or something comparable and publish these docs ourselves at some point.

At very least, it's probably good to have a backup, since ZenDesk doesn't have any backup or versioning of Help Center docs.
