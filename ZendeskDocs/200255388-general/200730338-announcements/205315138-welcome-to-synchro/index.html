      <h1>Welcome to Synchro!</h1>
      <p>The Synchro platform is now available.  You can download and install the Synchro server and use it to build apps.  You can also download the Synchro Explorer client on iOS, Android, Windows, and Windows Phone from the respective app stores to test your apps.  And you can serve Synchro apps as web apps, optimized for mobile and desktop browsers, either from Synchro server or from your own web app infrastructure.</p>
<p>The <strong>Synchro App Builder</strong>, used to create custom mobile clients that you can distribute to end users, is currently in pre-release testing. If you would like a custom native mobile client for your Synchro app before the Synchro App Builder is made available to the public, please open a support ticket and we will assist you.</p>
<p>The best way to get started writing Synchro apps is probably to go through our <a href="/hc/en-us/sections/204233727">step-by-step Tutorial</a>.</p>
<p>In addition, we would love to hear about the projects where you want to use Synchro, and we'll help out however we can.  Feel free to open a ticket for that too, or just to say hello!</p>
