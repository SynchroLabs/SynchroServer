      <h1>Introduction to Synchro</h1>
      <div>
<h2>What is Synchro?</h2>
<p class="lead wysiwyg-text-align-left">Synchro allows you to create feature-rich, robust, and secure cross-platform mobile apps that look and feel native on mobile devices, but run on the server, and are updateble in real-time. And it allows you to do this in a fraction of the amount of code required by other mobile application development platforms.</p>
<p class="lead wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img class="wysiwyg-text-align-center" src="https://synchro.io/images/users.png" alt="" /></p>
<p class="lead">To the user a Synchro-built app presents as a no-compromise native mobile app, and to developers and administrators it presents as a web app. It's really the best of both worlds.</p>
<p class="lead wysiwyg-text-align-center"> </p>
<h2>How Do We Do It?</h2>
<p class="lead">The short answer is that we do this by rendering your mobile client user interface on the mobile device, but running all of your mobile client code, including user interaction logic, on the server. You provide a small amount of platform-neutral UX code that we run on the server, and the Synchro platform provides the native mobile code and server framework to make it all work.</p>
</div>
<h2>The Longer Version...</h2>
<p>The long answer is, well, longer. In order to run the client logic on the server, but still render native, responsive applications on mobile devices, we need a strong separation between the client view and the client application logic (since they're running on different devices). We were inspired by contemporary data binding techniques and the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) design pattern. We particularly liked <a href="http://www.mvvmlight.net/">MVVM Light</a> in the DotNet world and <a href="http://knockoutjs.com/">Knockout.js</a> in the JavaScript world as examples of cleanly separating presentation from data and interaction.</p>
<p>In this pattern, each page or screen is represented by a <strong>View</strong> that defines the presentation of the user interface, including controls and their layout, and a <strong>ViewModel</strong> that contains the data represented in the View, as well as commands to process user interactions with the View. The View definition also contains declarative bindings that describe the relationship between the View and the ViewModel (for example, which ViewModel elements are used to populate which View controls, and which ViewModel commands are launched when users interact with various controls in different ways, etc).</p>
<p>These declarative bindings allow us to fully automate the View, meaning that there is no need for you to write any procedural code to get or set View contents or state, and this is what allows us to render and run the View on the other site of a network connection from the ViewModel. Also, unlike many other MVVM or similar systems, we don't require you to do anything in your ViewModel implementation to make this happen (you don't have to notify anyone when you make a data change, and you don't have to tell us which data elements we need to observe - we just figure it out and handle it automatically).</p>

<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"> </p>
<p>The diagram above shows how we implement our client-server MVVM solution. Your Synchro app will consist of a View and ViewModel implementation on the server. The Synchro platform provides the native mobile client apps and the server infrastructure to make the magic happen.</p>

<h2>Why Should You Care?</h2>
<p><br /><img src="https://synchro.io/icons/cross-platform.png" alt="" /></p>
<h3>Cross Platform</h3>
<p>The code that runs on the mobile client is created and provided by us, and is not specific to your application. We offer that code, packaged for you, linked to your server endpoint, and branded as your app, on Android, iOS, Windows, and Windows Phone platforms via the <strong>Synchro App Builder</strong>. Your code runs on the server and is the same regardless of the client OS your user is running. You do have the ability to tweak and tune your app based on the mobile client OS (or other device metrics), but that's usually not necessary.</p>

<h3>Less Code</h3>
<p>We were frustrated in our own efforts writing enterprise mobile clients by the amount of code required that was not core to the focus of the application. Most of this code fell into one of two categories: UX babysitting (setting up the UX and populating it, writing various handlers, notifiers, etc), and the client side of network client-server functions (typically talking to our own servers, usually via a REST API or some third-party tool that was supposed to make it easier). In Synchro, we have dramatically reduced, and in many cases completely elimiated, the code required in both of those categories.</p>
<p>In one popular cross platform benchmark, the <a href="http://propertycross.com/">PropertyCross</a> application, the Synchro implementation was done in 1/20th the amount of code of the native implementation, 1/10th the amount of code of the Xamarin implementation, and 1/4 the amout of code of the Appcelerator Titanium implementation. And our version stands up to all of them in terms of native look-and-feel, functionality, and responsiveness.</p>
<div class="lead wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img class="wysiwyg-text-align-center" src="https://synchro.io/images/loc.png" alt="" /></div>
<p>The Synchro implementation of PropertyCross is 242 lines of code, and that includes the view templates that define the page layouts. Another Synchro app, <strong>Synchro Civics</strong>, was implemented in under 200 lines of code. To install <strong>Synchro Civics</strong> on your mobile device and see what can be done in 200 lines of code, see <a href="https://synchro.io/getstarted">Get Started</a>.</p>

<h3>Massively Streamlined Client-Server Development</h3>
<p>Most enterprise mobile applications are client-server applications that revolve around the mobile client application interacting with one or more existing enterprise resources (services, data sources, etc). Implementing the client side of these interactions introduces many challenges, including authentication, access-control, connection/network management, state management, caching, and more.</p>
<p>Consider a simple example: You have customer data stored in a SQL database, and the mobile application needs to be able to search that database and display that customer data. If you implement something like this as a web app, your web app will simply authenticate to the database (as an application), perform a query, and populate the response with the data. But you can't very well let a mobile app talk directly to a SQL database for a number of reasons. You can't distribute application-level access credentials to the mobile app (that it stores and uses for access). Since the mobile app has its own release schedule, you can't have it rely on a specific database schema. For these and other reasons, you will typically end up building some kind of front-end to the database for your mobile app to use (either building a custom REST API, or perhaps by using some third-party tool to help). And that creates its own set of issues, including per-user access control, API versioning, network/connection management, etc.</p>
<p>With Synchro, because your mobile client application logic is running in a server environment, much like a web application, that code can talk directly to your enterprise resources without that extra layer of client-server logic. Your mobile app code will look a lot more like the clean, simple web app version of that application.</p>

<h3>Provable Security</h3>
<p>In the Synchro model, the mobile client communicates with a single Synchro endpoint over a secure connection (in fact, the mobile client device cannot communicate with any other server or network endpoint). Other than a session token, the mobile client does not maintain any local state (no local data storage, no cached data, etc). None of your data is exposed on device storage or over the connection. And since Synchro apps are running on the server, you can monitor usage and even revoke the ability for any or all users to access the application, in real time.</p>
<p><br /><img src="https://synchro.io/icons/node.png" alt="" /></p>
<h3>Enterprise-friendly Platform</h3>
<p>The server side of Synchro is implemented in <a href="https://nodejs.org/">Node.js</a>, which is widely used in the enterprise. Node.js is a mature, well-supported platform with the ability to connect to just about anything. Your Synchro apps will run under Node.js and be implemented in JavaScript. If you know and/or love Node.js or JavaScript, then you are going to love Synchro as a mobile app solution. If you don't know anything about Node.js, you can still be up and running very quickly (and you'll learn to love it - trust us).</p>
