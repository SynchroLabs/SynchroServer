      <h1>Help, I have a question and I need an answer</h1>
      <p>The Help Center search bar is your first step in finding an answer. Â If you've tried that and didn't find an answer, go ahead and submit a support request using the "Submit a request" link on this (and every) page.</p>
<p>Note that you will have to set up an account on Synchro.io and be signed in in order to submit a request.</p>
<p>If your question really isn't addressed in our docs, we'll usually create a new knowledge base article that addresses your issue, then point you to it.</p>
